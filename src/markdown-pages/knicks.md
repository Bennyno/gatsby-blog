### The knicks are in the playoffs for the second time in 3 years.

I've been a Knicks fan for almost 20 years. I became a fan when I was 16 or 17 years old, and I'll be 35 this year. The team hasn't been particularly good, but I became a fan because they represented the city I grew up in, New York. Despite their sometimes horrid seasons, I stuck by my team, and this year the fans have been rewarded with a team that's not just good, but actually has a chance to make a deep run in the NBA playoffs.

We signed Jalen Brunson over the offseason and I thought he'd be good, but wow has he exceeded all expectations. He's been a huge addition to the team and a key reason why the Knicks have far exceeded preseason predictions. But Brunson isn't the only reason why the Knicks are flourishing. Julius Randle has gone back to his All-Star caliber play, after a down season last year. The growth of our young second and third year players, Immanuel Quickley, Obi Toppin, Quentin Grimes, and Miles McBride, has played a huge factor in our improvement as well. The addition of Isaiah Hartenstein and Josh Hart have been instrumental as well, and we can't forget the defensive play and rebounding of Mitchell Robinson. This is the most promising Knicks team I've seen since I've been a fan, and it's an exciting time for myself and the city.

Go New York, go New York, go!! Orange and blue skies, baby!
