### My thoughts on completeing the Complete React in 2023 Course

I initially got into web development back in 2015, when I started using free online resources, mainly Codecademy. I would go online and do the reading and go through the exercises daily. It was something that really interested me. After a few months, I fell off from it. Life and responsibilities got in the way, and I stopped doing something I genuinely enjoyed.

Years later, I decided to pick it up again. One day, I opened my email and saw an email from Heroku. It reminded me of a project I had started back in 2016. That reignited something in me to get back into web development. So, I started taking an online course at my own pace, and soon after joined a full-stack web development bootcamp, which I completed back in December 2022.

I then completed the Zero to Mastery Full Stack Course, followed by the Zero to Mastery Junior to Senior course. And as of yesterday, I completed the React Developer in 2023 by Zero to Mastery. I've learned so much through these courses, and I am very proud to add another piece to my knowledge puzzle. I'm looking forward to continue learning and growing as I look to get my first job in web development.
