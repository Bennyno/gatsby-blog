### My thoughts on completeing the Complete React in 2023 Course

I initially got into web development back in 2015, when I started using free online resources, mainly codecademy. I would go online and do the reading and go through the exercises daily. It was something that really interested me. After a few months of this I fell off from it. Life and responsibilites got in the way and I stopped doing something I genuinely enjoyed. Years later I decided to pick it up again. One day I opened my email and I had an email from heroku. It reminded me of a project I had started back in 2016. That reignited something in me to get back into web development, so I started taking an online course at my own pace, and soon after joined a full stack web development bootcamp, which I completed back in December 2022. I then completed the Zero To Mastery Full Stack Course, followed by the Zero To Mastery Junior to Senior coures. And as of yesterday I completed the React Developer in 2023 by Zero To Mastery. I've learned so much through these courses and I am very proud to add another piece to my knowledge puzzle. I'm looking forward to continue learning and growing as I look to get my first job in Web Development.
