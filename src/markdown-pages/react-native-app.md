### My thoughts as I work on creating this mobile app

As of last week, I took a deep dive into learning React Native for mobile development. It was something that I wanted to get into for a while, since what initially drew me into web development was the desire to create my own app back in 2015. I'm at the point where I feel confident in my skills in React, so it was time to add React Native to my repertoire.

I'm currently working on an app where you can search for restaurants, look up information and reviews on the restaurants, and even look them up on a map. I'm using the yarn package manager instead of npm, which is what I normally use. I'm also learning to use Expo for mobile development, as well as using Android Studio to use an Android phone emulator on my computer.

It's been a great experience so far, as I'm really liking yarn as a package manager and Expo, both are awesome tools. I set a timeframe to be done with this app by this weekend, and then it's on to the next.

As far as job searching goes, I showed my portfolio to a friend of my girlfriend and he thought my portfolio looked really good and even sent me a link to apply to a job at a company he felt I might be able to have some luck with. I applied right away, but as of right now the job search is really difficult. I've applied to many jobs and have received nothing but rejection emails to date.

I'm going to continue applying and simultaneously try to build my network to give myself a better chance at getting an interview at least. I just know that if someone takes a chance on me and gets to know me, I'd be able to make a good impression and get my foot in the door. Fingers crossed!

Until next time,

Ben
